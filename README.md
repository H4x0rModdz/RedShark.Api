## Voting System

Weâ€™re big believers in community-driven innovation. Thatâ€™s why Red-Shark uses a GitHub voting system for decision-making. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. Got a brilliant idea? Submit it as a proposal on GitHub.
2. The community dives inâ€”discussing, debating, and refining the proposal.
3. GitHub likes become votes. The idea with the most likes wins.

Itâ€™s democracy, developer-style. No committees, no red tapeâ€”just the best ideas rising to the top.

## Contribution Guidelines

To keep Red-Shark awesome, we ask all contributors to follow these guidelines:

1. **Keep It Clean:** Write clear, maintainable code that everyone can understand.
2. **Document Everything:** Every pull request should explain what it does and why it matters.
3. **Play Nice:** Offer constructive feedback and respect your fellow devs.
4. **Test Before You Submit:** Nobody likes broken buildsâ€”run your tests first.
5. **Follow the Code of Conduct:** Weâ€™re building a positive, inclusive community. Letâ€™s keep it that way.
